**MoveMed** was created with continuous movement in mind!

How you move (and how often you move) can make all the difference in your wellness, especially when it's at the direction of a professional.  
As true as this is, it can be hard to remember what exercises you were given, or how often you should do them - and sometimes, when you're at home and something happens during an exercise - you can forget to mention it in your visit!  

With MoveMed, the communication between provider and client is not broken after leaving the office.  
Providers can create exercises, and assign those exercises with unique details to a client. They can also assign a specific goal to the client - to help them stay motivated and on track. Clients can then view their goal and customized exercises anytime, without having to find a folded up paper or searching through their email. Comments between providers and the client help add feedback in real time and maintain progress.
